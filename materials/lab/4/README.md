# Lab 4

## Required [10 points]
- Update wyoassign.go by specifically updating: `func UpdateAssignment`
- Update main.go to enable this new route
- Use postman to exercise/run through ALL of the available endpoints
- Save the responses from each run and place them in one text file


## Option 1
- Create a new set of endpoints for "classes" 
  - create new data structure(s) and 
  - create new endpoints (minimum create, get, delete)
  - update main.go 

## Option 2
- Modify/Harden the existing wyoassign.go endpoints
- Current endpoints lack real testing
- The POST / Create Assignment endpoint is terrible

## Option 3
- Create a wyoassign_test.go file which tests the functionality of the code
